# ✅ KYC Compliance Tracker – Excel Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project features a dynamic Excel dashboard designed to track and analyze **KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance status** for clients. It helps organizations monitor pending verifications, risk levels, due statuses, and document submission trends in a visually intuitive format.

The dashboard supports data filtering using slicers for:
- Risk Level (High, Medium, Low)
- KYC Status (Completed vs Pending)
- Due Status (Overdue, Due Soon, Not Due)

It is ideal for compliance teams, auditors, and operations managers.

## 🧹 What I Did

- Created PivotTables to summarize compliance info
- Built slicers to filter by:

  - Donut Chart (Due Status)
  - Clustered Columns (KYC Completed vs Pending, Risk-wise Submissions)
  - Pie & Bar for summary comparison

## 📊 Key Insights

1. **29 clients are compliant**, while **21 are non-compliant**
2. **High-risk clients** have more incomplete document submissions
3. Most clients fall under the **"Pending"** KYC status
4. A large number of cases are in **“Due Soon”** or **“Overdue”** stages
5. Low-risk clients are not necessarily more compliant

## 💡 Recommendations

- 🔁 **Prioritize follow-ups** with high-risk clients who are non-compliant
- 🟠 **Address "Due Soon" and "Overdue" cases** immediately to avoid legal/regulatory issues
- 📌 Encourage complete document submission to improve compliance status
